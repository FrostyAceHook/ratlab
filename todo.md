- "remoce two chars from points to user" bro wtf does this MEAN lmao
- only transform bare commands into calls.
- `rotate` function which does brfilters np shift
- shortened matrix print
- matrix eig
- maybe restructure matrix to only be "instantiated" when required and tack a
    "callable" onto each one. this would allow things like `x.summ` and
    `x.summ(0)`(meaning `x.summ_along(0)`) to work. however, its like kinda a
    terrible idea.
- numpy and sympy forwarding :)))
