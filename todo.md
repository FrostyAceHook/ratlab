- "remoce two chars from points to user" bro wtf does this MEAN lmao
- numpy backing + remove generic field
- add `reshape`
- super specialised bool matrix:
    - doesnt support `__bool__` unless single
    - is always iterable, to allow `all` and `any`
    - natural consequence of this is empty must be alled or anyed
- colour more prints (generic field, rational, empty list?)
- figure out indexing via mask
- make field rep take all objects to string, so it can homogenise the display
- `rotate` function which does brfilters np shift
- shortened matrix print
- matrix eig
- sympy integration
- make 'prog' file which handles logo, help msg, cmdline args, coloured printing,
    error msgs, whatever
- add argument to execute without syntax changes (aka just includes the default
    ratlab imports)
- rename 'syntax' to 'engine'
